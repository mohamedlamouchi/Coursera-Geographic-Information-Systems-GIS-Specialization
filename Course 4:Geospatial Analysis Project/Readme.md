## PROJECT: Roermond flash flood Netherland July 2021

### Mohamed Lamouchi -July 2022

### Abstract

> As a geospatial analyst, and as part of Cousera GIS geospecialisation, we have choose to analyze theepisode of flash flood that occurred in Roermond Netherland in July 2021 (https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/148598/deadly-floods-surprise-europe). extreme J rainfall swamped parts of Western Europe. Some of the worst-hit areas saw as much as two months of rain within 24 hoursâ€”enough to break precipitation records, push rivers to new heights, and trigger devastating flash floods.
The flood along the Meuse and Roer rivers was captured in 18 July by Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and was compared after transformation to a raster captured in 16 Juin and a layout of the limit of urban town of Roermond and to calculate the actual area in hectare under water.
